# Dragon x WinPacks
A clone of a clone (cloneception?): A clone of the game Heavy Bird which is a clone of the widely-popular game Flappy Bird. The only difference is that it doesn't score up when you pass a tower. It scores++ when you collect packs. Oh, and it uses a dragon instead of bird.

## Notes
* The dragon is not yet a smooth flyer.
* I should be able to put winpacks better.

## Wasn't this named "Don't Touch My Birdie"?

I integrated the game with Kik some time after releasing it initially. It got a bit popular there and @austinhallock from Clay.IO noticed. Since then I've been getting advices from him on how to improve the game. The new name and art are parts of the changes we've been trying out.
